      <p className="mb-4">
        We aim to process and ship your orders as quickly as possible.
        Typically, orders are processed within 1-3 business days. During peak
        seasons, holidays, or unexpected circumstances, processing times may
        vary. We understand that timely delivery is crucial for our customers,
        so we will communicate any significant delays as soon as possible. Our
        goal is to ensure that you receive your order in a timely manner while
        maintaining the highest quality standards in packaging and shipping.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Shipping Methods:</strong> We offer multiple shipping options,
        including standard, expedited, and express delivery. You can select your
        preferred shipping method at checkout based on your urgency and budget.
        Each shipping method is designed to meet different needs, whether you're
        planning for a special event or need something urgently. We partner with
        reliable carriers to ensure your package arrives safely and promptly.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Shipping Charges:</strong> Shipping fees are calculated based on
        your order's weight, dimensions, and delivery location. You will be able
        to review the shipping charges before finalizing your purchase, allowing
        you to make informed decisions. Occasionally, we may offer promotions
        such as free shipping on orders over a certain amount, providing you
        with an opportunity to save on shipping costs while enjoying your
        shopping experience.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>International Shipping:</strong> We currently provide shipping
        to select international destinations. Please note that international
        shipments may incur customs duties and taxes, which are the
        responsibility of the recipient. These fees can vary significantly
        depending on the destination country, so we recommend checking with your
        local customs office for specific regulations and potential fees to
        avoid unexpected charges. We strive to make international shopping as
        convenient as possible, and we appreciate your understanding of these
        additional considerations.
